**Application Banner for Wordpress**
★★★★★

With this plugin you can integrate a banner in the header and e.g. present your application, which is in the Google PlayStore or AppleStore. Please note that the banner is only visible on the mobile version - talk to your mobile phone!

The plugin differentiates whether someone is on your website with an Iphone or Android phone and shows the appropriate banner.

= Features =

* Adds a banner to the header (Google Play Store & Apple Store)
* If someone clicks the banner away, it will remain inactive for 3 days thanks to the cookie.

Bring a new shopping experience for your customers and benefit from "purchase on account", the most popular payment method in e-commerce. You don't have an application for your website yet? Simply contact us by email: kontakt@sahu.media
